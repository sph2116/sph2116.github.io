               Apophenia is the condition of seeing or imagining patterns in random occurrences and is a defining feature of many conspiracy theorists. People who have bought into conspiracy theories often feel like they have “arrived at a profound new realization about the world on their own” and believe that they can see patterns, connections, and codes that others cannot see, which serve to reinforce these realizations.&thinsp;<sup class = "tip"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>

                Apophenia manifests visually in images posted by conspiracy theorists as circles and arrows drawing connections between seemingly random things, juxtapositions of unrelated people, events, and objects, and finding deeper meaning in innocuous images. For people susceptible to to believing in conspiracy theories, finding collusion, connection and intention behind complex and incomprehensible events (coronavirus, global warming) can provide a sense of control and offer convenient explanations for “things that feel inexplicable or wrong about the world.”&thinsp;<sup class = "tip"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> Finding and cracking hidden codes also has an element of fantasy to it, allowing adherents to construct thrilling narratives that can provide escape from their current realities.

                Additionally, for adherents to widespread conspiracy theories like Qanon, finding connections and cracking codes is a community activity with great social benefit: “To belong to the QAnon pack is to be part of a massive crowdsourcing project that sees itself cracking a mystery.”&thinsp;<sup class = "tip"><a href="#1">3</a></sup> Participants in this project, who are more likely to feel marginalized and outcast by society, can validate each other’s worldviews and co-create an alternative reality that provides them with a framework for understanding the world.
