                If one of the characteristics of fascism is permanent warfare against an imagined (usually foreign) enemy, it makes sense that images that circulate in far-right internet forums often contain references to the Crusades, the centuries-long series of religious wars waged by the Church to secure various holy sites in the Middle East from Islamic rule. Images and symbols associated with the Crusades were popularized after 9/11 and have overtly racist and Islamaphobic connotations. Far-right protesters use these images and symbols to portray themselves as Christian warriors fighting for an America under seige by Muslim terrorists, immigrants, and other enemies that threaten white supremacy.&thinsp;<sup class = "tip"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>

                This narrative blends in with the pop-culture medieval fantasy portrayed in video games and shows like <i>Game of Thrones</i>, which depict knights as hypermasculine, heroic warriors carrying out a religious duty to defend their homeland (and their damsels in distress) against hostile outsiders.&thinsp;<sup class = "tip"><a href="#1">2</a></sup> Indeed, it is probable that the far right’s appropriation of Crusader symbols is taken from pop culture rather than historical sources. For example, alt-right neo-crusaders often use the term “Deus Vult” (Latin for “God Wills It”), which was first popularized in video games like <i>For Honor</i> and <i>Crusader Kings</i> (the term has since been banned in recent releases of <i>Crusader Kings</i>).

                By drawing connections between the Crusades and current events in the US, alt-righters create a continuous narrative of whiteness under attack and an ongoing war between civilizations. These symbols lend a thin veil of historical and religious justification to the alt-right cause, making them potent tools in spreading the far-right message of militancy and aggression against non-white “invaders.”
