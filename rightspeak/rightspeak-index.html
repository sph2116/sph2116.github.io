      <h4>
          Images are grouped by categories adapted from Umberto Eco's essay <a href="ur-fascism.html">Ur-Fascism</a>, which lists 14 features of what he dubs “eternal fascism.” The tags highlight the way the images and symbols of the alt-right connect to the communications strategies of fascist and totalitarian regimes throughout history.
      </h4>
      
    <div class = "drawer-item">
        <div class = "tag">Cult of tradition</div>
        <p class = "drawer-description" data-tag = "cult-of-tradition">The cult of tradition idealizes a primordial past. It is characterized by synthesis of often contradictory traditional beliefs and practice, which supposedly allude to the same primeval truths that reaffirm fascist narratives about racial superiority.</p>
    </div>
       
     <div class = "drawer-item">
        <div class = "tag">Attack on rationality</div>
        <p class = "drawer-description"  data-tag = "attack-on-rationality">The attack on rationality rejects the rationalistic development of Western culture. It is often characterized by anti-intellectualism and manifests in attacks on modern culture and science.</p>
    </div>
      
     <div class = "drawer-item">
        <div class = "tag">Disagreement is treason</div>
        <p class = "drawer-description" data-tag = "disagreement-is-treason">Fascism devalues intellectual discourse and critical reasoning as barriers to action, as well as out of fear that such analysis will expose the contradictions embodied in its ideology.</p>
    </div>
      
     <div class = "drawer-item">
        <div class = "tag">Fear of difference</div>
        <p class = "drawer-description" data-tag = "fear-of-difference">Fascism seeks to exploit fear of difference, whether racial, sexual, gendered, or religious.</p>
    </div>
      
     <div class = "drawer-item">
        <div class = "tag">Social frustration</div>
        <p class = "drawer-description" data-tag = "social-frustration">One of the most typical features of fascism is the appeal to frustrated social classes “suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation.”</p>
    </div>
      
    <div class = "drawer-item">
        <div class = "tag">Obsession with plots</div>
        <p class = "drawer-description" data-tag = "obsession-with-plots">Followers in fascist regimes must feel beseiged. This often combines an appeal to xenophobia with a fear of disloyalty and sabotage from marginalized groups living within the society.</p>
    </div>
      
    <div class = "drawer-item">
        <div class = "tag">Permanent Warfare</div>
        <p class = "drawer-description" data-tag = "permanent-warfare">There must always be an enemy to fight. This principle leads to a fundamental contradiction within fascism: the incompatibility of ultimate triumph with perpetual war.</p>
    </div>
      
    <div class = "drawer-item">
        <div class = "tag">Contempt for the weak</div>
        <p class = "drawer-description" data-tag = "contempt-for-the-weak">An attitude linked to popular elitism, in which every member of society is superior to outsiders by virtue of belonging to the in-group.</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "drawer-item">
        <div class = "tag">Cult of Heroism &amp; Death</div>
        <p class = "drawer-description" data-tag = "cult-of-heroism-death">In Ur-Fascism, everybody is educated to become a hero, which leads to the embrace of a cult of death. As Eco observes, "[t]he Ur-Fascist hero is impatient to die. In his impatience, he more frequently sends other people to death."</p>
    </div>
      
    <div class = "drawer-item">
        <div class = "tag">Cult of masculinity</div>
        <p class = "drawer-description" data-tag = "cult-of-masculinity">The cult of masculinity tends to manifest itself in an obsession with sexual politics. This machismo "implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.”</p>
    </div>
      
    <div class = "drawer-item">
        <div class = "tag">Selective populism</div>
        <p class = "drawer-description" data-tag = "selective-populism">In Ur-Fascism, the will of the “People” is conveived as a monolithic entity, superior to the will of any individual. The Leader pretends to be their interpreter, leading to a condition in which a small group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the “Voice of the People.”</p>
    </div>
      
    <div class = "drawer-item">
        <div class = "tag">Newspeak</div>
        <p class = "drawer-description" data-tag = "Newspeak">Fascism employs and promotes an impoverished vocabulary in order to limit critical reasoning.</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "drawer-item">
        <div class = "tag">Worship of Technology</div>
        <p class = "drawer-description" data-tag = "worship-of-technology">Fascist regimes reject science but have faith in technology as a means to conquer and to reaffirm inegalitarianism.</p>
