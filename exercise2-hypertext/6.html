            ’Twas <a href="7-r.html">brillig</a>, and the slithy toves <br>
            Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; <br>
            All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
            And the mome raths outgrabe.

           “Beware the Jabberwock, my son! <br>
            The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! <br>
            Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun <br>
            The <a href="index.html">frumious</a> Bandersnatch!”

            He took his vorpal sword in hand:<br>
            Long time the manxome foe he sought—<br>
            So rested he by the <a href="7.html">Tumtum tree</a>,<br>
            And stood awhile in thought.
        </p> 
        
          <p>
            And as in uffish thought he stood,<br>
            The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br>
            Came <a href="3.html">whiffling</a> through the tulgey wood,<br>
            And burbled as it came!
        </p> 
        
        <p>
           One, two! One, two! And through and through <br>
           The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! <br>
           He left it dead, and with its <a href="7.html">head</a> <br>
           He went <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/galumphing">galumphing</a> back.
