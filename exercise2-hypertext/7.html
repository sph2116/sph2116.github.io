            ’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves <br>
            Did gyre and <a href="2-r.html">gimble</a> in the wabe; <br>

            The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! <br>
            Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun <br>

            He took his vorpal <a href="1.html">sword</a> in hand:<br>
            Long time the manxome foe he sought—<br>
            So rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br>
            And stood awhile in thought.

           One, two! One, two! And through and through <br>
           The vorpal <a href="index.html">blade</a> went snicker-snack! <br>
           He left it dead, and with its head <br>
           He went galumphing back.
